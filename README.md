# Throttle Motor Control with Hall Sensor

Welcome to the **Throttle Motor Control with Hall Sensor** repository! This project offers a proficient control mechanism for motors using a Hall-effect throttle sensor. The core advantage of this code is delivering smooth and adjustable acceleration/deceleration responses based on the Hall sensor input.

## üöÄ Features

- **Debounce Mechanism**: Assures only substantial changes in the Hall sensor throttle position are processed, negating any minor jittery fluctuations.
  
- **Ease-in Acceleration**: Achieve polished acceleration or deceleration based on the variance between the current and target speed, granting full reign over motor behavior.
  
- **Speed Mapping**: Converts Hall sensor readings (analog input) to a suitable motor speed (PWM output).

- **Safety Clamps**: Enforces PWM limits to ensure motor safety.

## üß∞ Prerequisites

- **Hardware**:
  - Motor with a PWM-compatible driver.
  - Throttle based on a Hall-effect sensor.
  - Arduino board or equivalent microcontroller.
  
- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE or an analogous platform for programming your microcontroller.

## üõ† Setup

1. Connect the Hall-effect throttle sensor to the analog pin designated as `throttlePin` (default: A0).
2. Interface the motor driver's PWM input to the digital pin denoted as `motorPin` (default: pin 3).
3. Power your board and upload the included code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The code presents several adjustable parameters:

- **`accelerationFactor`**: Modulate the intensity of the ease-in acceleration. Smaller values yield a gentler motor reaction to throttle alterations, while bigger values elicit a brisker response.
  
- **`speedDifferenceThreshold`**: Dictates when the motor directly matches the target speed versus utilizing the ease-in technique.
  
- **`debounceThreshold` & `debounceInterval`**: Fine-tune the debounce system for the throttle to heighten responsiveness or mitigate jitters.

Personalize these settings for the desired motor activity.
